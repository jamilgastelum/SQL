# SQL Projects Showcase
Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I'm sharing my SQL learning journey. These projects are a reflection of my progress from a beginner to an intermediate SQL enthusiast.

In this collection, you'll find simple SQL projects that I've completed as I've honed my skills. As a fellow learner, I wanted to create a space for those who are just starting or are at a similar stage in their SQL journey. These projects are approachable and tailored to beginners, making them ideal for anyone looking to learn SQL from a relatable perspective.

I invite you to explore these projects, review my code, and adapt them for your own learning. If you have questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to connect with me. I'm here to share and learn together on this SQL adventure.
