# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

# 1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

# 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID' AND Product = 'iPhone';

# 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum, order_ID
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DBFebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

# 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

# 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

# 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln, St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity) * price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

# 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2 
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
